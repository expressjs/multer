# Multer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/multer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/multer) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/multer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/multer)

Multer is a node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`.

It is written on top of [busboy](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy) for maximum efficiency.

## API

#### Installation

`$ npm install multer`

#### Usage

```js
var express = require('express')
var multer  = require('multer')

var app = express()
app.use(multer({ dest: './uploads/'}))
```

You can access the fields and files in the `request` object:

```js
console.log(req.body)
console.log(req.files)
```

**IMPORTANT**: Multer will not process any form which is not `multipart/form-data` submitted via the `POST` or `PUT` methods.

## Multer file object

A multer file object is a JSON object with the following properties.

1. `fieldname` - Field name specified in the form
2. `originalname` - Name of the file on the user's computer
3. `name` - Renamed file name
4. `encoding` - Encoding type of the file
5. `mimetype` - Mime type of the file
6. `path` - Location of the uploaded file
7. `extension` - Extension of the file
8. `size` - Size of the file in bytes
9. `truncated` - If the file was truncated due to size limitation

## Options

Multer accepts an options object, the most basic of which is the `dest` property, which tells Multer where to upload the files. In case you omit the options object, the file will be renamed and uploaded to the temporary directory of the system.

By the default, Multer will rename the files so as to avoid name conflicts. The renaming function can be customized according to your needs.

The following are the options that can be passed to Multer.

* `dest`
* `limits`
* `rename(fieldname, filename)`
* `onFileUploadStart(file)`
* `onFileUploadData(file, data)`
* `onFileUploadComplete(file)`
* `onParseStart()`
* `onParseEnd()`
* `onError()`
* `onFilesLimit()`
* `onFieldsLimit()`
* `onPartsLimit()`

Apart from these, Multer also supports more advanced [busboy options](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy#busboy-methods) like `highWaterMark`, `fileHwm`, and `defCharset`.

In an average web app, only `dest` and `rename` might be required, and configured as shown in the example.

```js
app.use(multer({
  dest: './uploads/',
  rename: function (fieldname, filename) {
    return filename.replace(/\W+/g, '-').toLowerCase() + Date.now()
  }
}))
```

The details of the properties of the options object is explained in the following sections.

### dest

The destination directory for the uploaded files.

`dest: './uploads/'`

### limits

An object specifying the size limits of the following optional properties.

* `fieldNameSize` - integer - Max field name size (Default: 100 bytes)
* `fieldSize` - integer - Max field value size (Default: 1MB)
* `fields` - integer - Max number of non-file fields (Default: Infinity)
* `fileSize` - integer - For multipart forms, the max file size (Default: Infinity)
* `files` - integer - For multipart forms, the max number of file fields (Default: Infinity)
* `parts` - integer - For multipart forms, the max number of parts (fields + files) (Default: Infinity)
* `headerPairs` - integer - For multipart forms, the max number of header key=>value pairs to parse Default: 2000 (same as node's http).

```js
limits: {
  fieldNameSize: 100,
  files: 2,
  fields: 5
}
```

Specifying the limits can help protect your site against denial of service (DoS) attacks.

### rename(fieldname, filename)

Function to rename the uploaded files. Whatever the function returns will become the new name of the uploaded file (extension is not included). The `fieldname` and `filename` of the file will be available in this function, use them if you need to.

```js
rename: function (fieldname, filename) {
  return fieldname + filename + Date.now()
}
```

### onFileUploadStart(file)

Event handler triggered when a file starts to be uploaded. A file object with the following properties are available to this function: `fieldname`, `originalname`, `name`, `encoding`, `mimetype`, `path`, `extension`.

```js
onFileUploadStart: function (file) {
  console.log(file.fieldname + ' is starting ...')
}
```

### onFileUploadData(file, data)

Event handler triggered when a chunk of buffer is received. A buffer object along with a file object is available to the function.

```js
onFileUploadData: function (file, data) {
  console.log(data.length + ' of ' + file.fieldname + ' arrived')
}
```

### onFileUploadComplete(file)

Event handler trigger when a file is completely uploaded. A file object is available to the function.

```js
onFileUploadComplete: function (file) {
  console.log(file.fieldname + ' uploaded to  ' + file.path)
}
```

### onParseStart()

Event handler triggered when the form parsing starts.

```js
onParseStart: function () {
  console.log('Form parsing started at: ', new Date())
}
```

### onParseEnd()

Event handler triggered when the form parsing completes.

```js
onParseStart: function () {
  console.log('Form parsing completed at: ', new Date())
}
```

### onError()

Event handler for any errors encountering while processing the form. The `error` object and the `next` object is available to the function. If you are handling errors yourself, make sure to terminate the request or call the `next()` function, else the request will be left hanging.

```js
onError: function (error, next) {
  console.log(error)
  next(error)
}
```

### onFilesLimit()

Event handler triggered when the number of files exceed the specification in the `limit` object. No more files will be parsed after the limit is reached.

```js
onFilesLimit: function () {
  console.log('Crossed file limit!')
}
```

### onFieldsLimit()

Event handler triggered when the number of fields exceed the specification in the `limit` object. No more fields will be parsed after the limit is reached.

```js
onFieldsLimit: function () {
  console.log('Crossed fields limit!')
}
```

### onPartsLimit()

Event handler triggered when the number of parts exceed the specification in the `limit` object. No more files or fields will be parsed after the limit is reached.

```js
onPartsLimit: function () {
  console.log('Crossed parts limit!')
}
```
