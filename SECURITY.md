## Reporting a Bug

The Multer team and community take all security bugs in Multer seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of Multer. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by creating an issue Bug report.

After the initial reply to your report, the community will do its best to fix the bug as soon as possible.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, the bug is attributed to a main handler. This person will coordinate the correction and release process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible to npm.
